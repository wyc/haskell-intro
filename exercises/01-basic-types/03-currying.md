1. Write a curried function called `mult` that multiplies two `Int`s.

2. Use `mult` to create a new function `multFive` that multiplies its single
   `Int` input with 5.

3. What's the difference between `(Int, Int) -> Int` and `Int -> Int -> Int`?

4. What's the practical difference between the function signatures `Int -> Int
   -> Int`, `Int -> (Int -> Int)`, and `(Int -> Int) -> Int`? What about
   style-wise?
